## About Me

Hey there! I’m Anthony, a passionate cyber security enthusiast 🔐 and a Computer Science Engineering student at Escuela Politécnica Nacional 👨‍🎓. I’m always excited to dive into new tech challenges and explore the world of ethical hacking 🌐.

Currently, I'm preparing for the CPTS certification 🛡️, pushing myself to expand my skills and knowledge in cyber security. I’ve already earned the eJPT certification with a high score (91%) 📜 and am constantly leveling up. On top of that, I’m studying for Cisco certifications in Ethical Hacking 🕵️‍♂️, Cybersecurity 🔒, and DevOps 💻, diving into network hacking—something I’m super passionate about 🌐🚀🔥.

My interests are diverse—I love working with Linux 🐧, Python 🐍, C++ 💻, and Bash. I also find Windows security environments 🔍 fascinating, often exploring services like Active Directory, LDAP, SMB, and Kerberos. I’m currently diving into how databases work, learning about OWASP vulnerabilities 🛠️, cracking hashes 🔑, and exploring different systems 🗄️.

On my blog, 7heAnsw3r, I share my journey—posting write-ups, hacking tutorials, and other cool content. You’ll find me breaking down challenges from Hack The Box and discussing new things I’m learning ✏️📓.
